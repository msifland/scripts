openssh (1:9.0p1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  OpenSSH 9.0 includes a number of changes that may affect existing
  configurations:

   * This release switches scp(1) from using the legacy scp/rcp protocol to
     using the SFTP protocol by default.

     Legacy scp/rcp performs wildcard expansion of remote filenames (e.g.
     "scp host:* .") through the remote shell. This has the side effect of
     requiring double quoting of shell meta-characters in file names
     included on scp(1) command-lines, otherwise they could be interpreted
     as shell commands on the remote side.

     This creates one area of potential incompatibility: scp(1) when using
     the SFTP protocol no longer requires this finicky and brittle quoting,
     and attempts to use it may cause transfers to fail. We consider the
     removal of the need for double-quoting shell characters in file names
     to be a benefit and do not intend to introduce bug-compatibility for
     legacy scp/rcp in scp(1) when using the SFTP protocol.

     Another area of potential incompatibility relates to the use of remote
     paths relative to other user's home directories, for example - "scp
     host:~user/file /tmp". The SFTP protocol has no native way to expand a
     ~user path. However, sftp-server(8) in OpenSSH 8.7 and later support a
     protocol extension "expand-path@openssh.com" to support this.

     In case of incompatibility, the scp(1) client may be instructed to use
     the legacy scp/rcp using the -O flag.
